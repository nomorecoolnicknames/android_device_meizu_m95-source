/* libmtkshim_net — ifc_ipv6_trigger_rs for the MTK RIL blobs.
 *
 * FACT (differential 2026-07-27, tools/blob-symdiff.py against the built ROM):
 * mtk-ril.so and mtk-rilmd2.so (both 32- and 64-bit) each have exactly ONE
 * unresolved symbol, ifc_ipv6_trigger_rs. It is an MTK addition to Nougat's
 * libnetutils; AOSP never had it, in any release.
 *
 * Semantics (INFERENCE from the name, the single `const char *ifname`
 * argument, and MTK's use of it on data-call bring-up): send an ICMPv6 Router
 * Solicitation on the named interface so SLAAC does not wait for the next
 * unsolicited Router Advertisement. Implemented for real rather than stubbed
 * to 0 — a no-op would link but silently slow or break IPv6 address
 * acquisition on mobile data, and that failure is much harder to diagnose
 * later than this function is to write.
 *
 * rild holds CAP_NET_RAW, so the raw ICMPv6 socket is permitted. The kernel
 * computes the ICMPv6 checksum itself for IPPROTO_ICMPV6 raw sockets
 * (required by RFC 3542 section 3.1), so the bare header below goes out valid.
 *
 * NOT VERIFIED on hardware: the ROM has never booted, so this has never sent a
 * packet. The signature is inferred, not read from an MTK header.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT included (the first draft of this file had them):
 *  - socket_loopback_client: only libviatelecom-withuim-ril.so wants it, a VIA
 *    CDMA modem lib irrelevant to this device's radio.
 *  - android_fork_execvp_ext: only libwo.so (China Unicom) wants it, and that
 *    blob is unloadable regardless — liblogwrap.so, one of its DT_NEEDED
 *    entries, does not exist on the image at all (see BLOB_SHIMS.md, "missing
 *    DT_NEEDED"). A forwarder that dlopen()s a library which is not there
 *    cannot work, so shipping one would be theatre.
